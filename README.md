# rc-building-model

A Resistance Capacitance (RC) Model for the Simulation of Building Stock Energy Usage.

Adapted from SEAI's Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP) which is based on both the European Standard IS EN 13790: 2004 and the UKâ€™s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP). 

> Inspired by [RC_BuildingSimulator](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/RC_BuildingSimulator) and [CityEnergyAnalyst](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/CityEnergyAnalyst)

To Do:

- [x] Annual **fabric** heat loss
- [x] Annual **ventilation** heat loss
- [ ] Annual **heat gain**
- [ ] Annual **space heat** demand
- [ ] Annual **hot water** demand
